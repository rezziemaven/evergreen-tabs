# Evergreen Tabs

An open source Chrome extension that opens a list of pinned, 'evergreen' tabs when a new window is opened. This extension was inspired by [Forever Pinned](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/forever-pinned/nigigpmchbpkjjgncmpiggfnikllldlh?pli=1), an outdated Chrome extension that may soon be removed by the Chrome Web Store as it no longer meets their best practices. The project is not open source, which was the motivation for building this extension.

## Features
- Opens a list of pinned tabs when a new window is opened.
- Edit list of pinned tabs by changing order or removing tabs
